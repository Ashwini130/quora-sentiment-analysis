A British soldier “shaking hands” with a kitten in the snow (Neulette, France, 1917)
“Robbers’ Roost”, one of the most dangerous place in New York City in 1888
Danish immigrant Jacob Riis started photographing the underbelly of New York in 1888. He set up shop across from the police station in the Five Points area of the city, known as the toughest area. In 1890 Riis published 
How The Other Half Lives
 which had the intent of showing that the poor were the victims, rather than the cause of bad living conditions.
The place depicted as “Robbers’ Roost” was at 59½ Mulberry Street. The building on the right was a “stale-beer dive” where drinkers could stay all night if they bought a few glasses. Stale beer was left outside legitimate taverns in barrels for pickup by brewery wagons. This stuff was stolen and various chemicals added to clarify it and make it foam. The resulting poisonous swill was sold for 2¢ a glass. The young ladies hanging out the window probably offered other services as well.
