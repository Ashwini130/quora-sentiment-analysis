What are some of your favorite podcasts to listen to in the morning?
I’ve recently gotten into listening to podcasts while getting ready for class or work. It varies between mythological ones like 
Lore 
and
 Myths and Legends 
and quirky ones like 
Welcome to Night Vale
. I’m looking for a few more to listen to. What are your favorites and why? Any genre welcome. Thanks!

Here’s an eclectic mix of podcasts I like listening to:
BBC’s From Our Own Correspondent
 (an in-depth look at the stories behind the top news headlines around the world, told by BBC correspondents, journalists and writers in a captivating storytelling format; hosted by Kate Adie)
Optimize with Brian Johnson
 
(condensed big ideas from the best books on optimal living and micro classes on how to apply these ideas; here’s where I get a lot of book recommendations, including most recently Seneca’s 
On the Shortness of Life
)
Invisibilia
 
(a show about invisible forces that affect and control human behavior: our ideas, beliefs, and emotions)
Intelligence Squared
 (the world’s leading forum for debate and intelligent discussion; I like the diversity of topics that are covered and that include Brexit, democracy, foreign intervention, capitalism, the art market, contemporary literature, feminism, events in the Middle East)
The Memory Palace
 (storytelling podcast about events from the past)
Middle East Analysis
 (podcast on events happening in the Middle East and North Africa regions; the main contributor is international lawyer and political advisor Dr. Harry Hagopian)
This Is Your Life with Michael Hyatt
 (a podcast dedicated to living a life with more passion, working with greater focus, and pursuing goals that give purpose and meaning to our lives)

Well, I don’t listen to podcasts on a regular basis but the ones I enjoy are:
HBR IdeaCast
 - Exposes me to different ideas, mainly in the realms of business and leadership.
Beyond Synth
 - Synthwave, retro, 80’s, movies, videogames, and Beyond! It’s just pure FUN with Andy Last!
The #AskGaryVee Show podcast!
 - Social media, business, entrepreneurship, startups, self-awareness, hustle, life, and more. Hosted by 
Gary Vaynerchuk
. Really solid and practical advice given in more of a 360-perspective than usual.
This Week in Startups
 - Startups, tech, Silicon Valley, news, etc. Hosted by 
Jason Calacanis
. Really great guests and insights into how people go about solving problems.
Kellman on CliffCentral
 - Offers a daily update of what’s up in pop culture. Hosted by Arye Kellman. The show is based in South Africa so it offers a bit of a different take on things, which I enjoy.
The Tim Ferriss Show
 - Interesting guests and ideas. Offers big picture thinking and philosophy on every day life, while also giving some really practical advice. 
Tim Ferriss
 However, the advice isn’t always applicable to everyone (especially on health, diet, and exercise!), so make sure to use your critical thinking skills.
How to Think Like a Freak
 - Offers some really thought provoking ideas and gets you thinking about how to think. Created by the authors of the book series 
“Freakonomics”
. If you haven’t read them yet, do it!
Happy listening!
