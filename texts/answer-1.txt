Accessing an unread email can be done using the below python script .
import poplib
import time

USERNAME = 'username'
PASSWORD ='password'
popserver = 'pop.gmail.com' 
pop = poplib.POP3_SSL(popserver)
pop.user(USERNAME)
pop.pass_(PASSWORD)

count , total_len = pop.stat()[0],pop.stat()[1]

print(" No of unread mail : ",count)
for c in range(count):
    for message in pop.retr(c+1)[1]:
        print(message)
    time.sleep(10)

Some pop3 servers
 :
http://pop.mail.yahoo.com
pop.aol.com
pop.att.yahoo.com
http://pop.gmail.com
Note :
The above script also generates some unnecessary information which can be refined for further usage .
You need to enable POP and IMAP access under settings .

Hi,
using this python script we can access our mail box.
import email, getpass, imaplib, os
detach_dir = '.' # directory where to save attachments (default: current)
user = raw_input("Enter your GMail username:")
pwd = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")
# connecting to the gmail imap server
m = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL("imap.gmail.com")
m.login(user,pwd)
m.select("cs2043") # here you a can choose a mail box like INBOX instead
# use m.list() to get all the mailboxes
resp, items = m.search(None, "ALL") # you could filter using the IMAP rules here (check http://www.example-code.com/csharp/imap-search-critera.asp)
items = items[0].split() # getting the mails id
for emailid in items:
 resp, data = m.fetch(emailid, "(RFC822)") # fetching the mail, "`(RFC822)`" means "get the whole stuff", but you can ask for headers only, etc
 email_body = data[0][1] # getting the mail content
 mail = email.message_from_string(email_body) # parsing the mail content to get a mail object
 #Check if any attachments at all
 if mail.get_content_maintype() != 'multipart':
 continue
 print "["+mail["From"]+"] :" + mail["Subject"]
 # we use walk to create a generator so we can iterate on the parts and forget about the recursive headach
 for part in mail.walk():
 # multipart are just containers, so we skip them
 if part.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart':
 continue
 # is this part an attachment ?
 if part.get('Content-Disposition') is None:
 continue
 #filename = part.get_filename()
 filename = mail["From"] + "_hw1answer"
 att_path = os.path.join(detach_dir, filename)
 #Check if its already there
 if not os.path.isfile(att_path) :
 # finally write the stuff
 fp = open(att_path, 'wb')
 fp.write(part.get_payload(decode=True))
 fp.close()

Thank you.
