Youtube Buffering
I'm pretty sure that many of you might have at-least one instance where you had to wait while a video on Youtube buffered.

You may ask, what is so amazing in that?!
Well, let me introduce you to...
Youtube Buffering Snake Game.
How do I start this game
? 
Whenever you happen to find your video buffering, strike one of the arrow keys on your keyboard and voila!  
How do I know if the game has started
?
The circularly moving dots will realign to form a straight line (or a combination of straight lines) along with a non-connected white dot (food for the snake).

Note: The white dot which is not connected to the main string is food for the snake. 
Rules?
Rules are pretty simple. It's a basic snake game where you'll have to feed the snake with white dots and thus increasing the length of the snake.
However, you'll have to make sure that you don't hit the boundaries (the video screen contours)

: Unexpected power cut. Sudden buffering. And an accidental strike on one of the arrow keys.
I hope you found it interesting.

Youtube had other crazy Easter Eggs which had already been mentioned earlier in many answers, so I have shared some of the forgotten hacks on Youtube.
One crazy fact of Youtube is that it is known for some of its ingenious “
puns
”
“Famous” Monkey Pun 
- Youtube
The problem doesn't appear to be affecting all the users. YouTube appears to be down, with users just presented with a huge string of characters if they try to access the site. This error page was quite funny.
When heading to 
YouTube
, users are presented with a warning that there is a "
500 Internal Server Error
". A joking message says that "
A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with this situation
", followed by a long string of text.Many social media users pointed out that the outage came very soon after YouTube launched its new paid-for service, called 
Youtube Red
.
Maximum View Count
See this number 
9,223,372,036,854,775,808 
, this has a unique relation with a video on Youtube. It is the maximum number of views a video can get after the internet sensation 
Gangnam Style
 hit the floors of Youtube. It forced Youtube to change the view counter from a 32-bit integer to a 64-bit integer that allows a number of views that takes effort to just say - 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.
As you may know, Gangnam Style, by the South Korean musician PSY, was the first YouTube video to ever reach 
One billion views
, which happened on 
December 21st 2012
. The success of the song had such a huge impact that YouTube representatives themselves made a Google+ post in which they stated how the platforms own view counter had to be upgraded, just because of it!
Coming to the “pun” part see this google+ post by Youtube dated Dec 1 2014.
Link here
See how Youtube is confident in mentioning that the view counter is still to be upgraded soon enough , although Youtube can be confident enough but a scene of Overconfidence is seen here.
1980 Game
To access the game, users can start playing any YouTube clip, click away from the video and type ‘1980’. The original video carries on playing but slides down the page, making room for the classic arcade game and its instruction: “Blow those missiles out of the sky!”

 : Google
Rockets then start raining down and users have to intercept them from their gun turrets. Once all gun turrets have been destroyed the game is over (
believe me it is harder than it looks.)
PS: 
This is now outdated
Geek Week
This is another weird trick in Youtube(
and this is not working now
). YouTube’s first ever Geek Week was advertised as a “celebration of all things geek”, featuring videos on how geek culture had been formed and “geekery from around the world.”
You have to type/Geek Week or /geek week in the search bar.

 : Google
301
This was a Youtube glitch few years back. When a new video goes up and starts to attract attention, Google wants to make sure that the views it is getting are real, and not dubious clicks coming from botnets or unscrupulous publishers who want to make their videos look more popular than they really are. 
So YouTube pauses the counter at 301 views while its systems subject the video — and its cached duplicates on servers all over the world — to a statistical process that verifies the traffic. 
The 301 phenomenon is one of the things that video publishers ask YouTube most about, Here's a
 video 
— which has more than 301 views — explaining the whole process.
This glitch was finally "
fixed
" in August 2015, but may it live on in our hearts.
Comic Book Mode
This was a fun mode where the video could be played in the 
Comic book mode. 
A special POW button appears on the playbar which is used to switch controls between the normal mode and the Comic Book Mode.
I tried it but now it’s dysfunctional yet this is how a video will look like
Youtube had other crazy Easter Eggs which had already been mentioned earlier in many answers, so I have shared some of the forgotten hacks on Youtube.
Sad part is all the above mentioned hacks are currently dysfunctional( 
at least upto my knowledge I have tried them but failed to achieve it
).
First Ever Youtube Video had a “Goat” along with the Elephant
Probably people should know this if they’ve searched for the video. 
Me at the zoo
 is the first-ever video that was uploaded to 
YouTube
. It was uploaded on April 23, 2005 at 20:27:12 
PDT
 (April 24, 2005 at 3:27:12 
UTC
) by the site's cofounder 
Jawed Karim
, with the username "jawed" and recorded by his high school friend Yakov Lapitsky.He created an account on YouTube the same day. The nineteen-second video was shot by Yakov Lapitsky at the 
San Diego Zoo
, featuring Karim in front of the 
elephants
 in their old exhibit in Elephant Mesa, professing his interest in their "
really, really, really long trunks
".
Actually no one can see the “
Goat
” in the video however go and click “ON” the annotations and @0:14 you will see what you should see.
Thanks for Scrolling :}

blocked in your country
 is

For Star Wars and Star Trek fans
If you are a 
Star Wars fan
, then there is some good news for you. YouTube has an easter egg just for you guys. Search YouTube for "use the force, Luke" to warp your screen. Star Trek fans need not be disappointed as there is an easter egg for them as well. Searching YouTube for "Beam me up, Scotty" reveals it.
YouTube Snakes Easter egg
You can play the classic Snakes game while watching any video in your browser. Just pause a video, hold the left arrow key for 2 seconds and while still holding it, press the Up arrow key. This only works in the new YouTube player on videos played on 
YouTube
.
do the Harlem shake
Search YouTube for "do the Harlem shake" and the entire page will shake violently with the song "Harlem Shake" by Baauer being played in the background.
