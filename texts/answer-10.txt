Most important thing to know about him is He’s all of self-made , self-taught person .
Some of his work :
A YouTube channel

 where he shares his knowledge on web development (Has 100k+ subscribers and 6million+ views ) and occasionally uploads some VLogs (on how he got his job at Google) too .
Worked at a Startup (Tubular labs ) before joining Google as Interaction Designer .
A Podcast web series 
Late Nights with Trav and Los

An weekly e-mail subscription on how to increase productivity , learning etc.
In one of his vLogs he has mentioned how important and challenging it was for him to get into Google , he did’t even complete his high school education . He then explains how he started his Youtube channel and started preparing for interviews by building small projects .
